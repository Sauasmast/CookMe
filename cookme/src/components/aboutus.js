            <p> There is a sweet lady out there in the world who does not like to eat much of the stuff. Actually, to be frank she is my sweetheart. I want her to be as healthy as possible 
            because I care about her. I do care about you guys too but I care her more than myself. Crazy Right !!! </p>
            <p> What this web app does is it will show you recipes on the basis of the ingredients. Enter what you have on the fridge and it will list foods that you can make out of the 
                ingredients that you put. Cool Right. I would like to thank my brothers for this idea. Especially the big one whom I had promised I would finish the project. I don't want to 
                take their name because they might kill me. Thank you by the way. All these words might sound crazy right but that's how I am, crazy. </p>
            <p> All of you out there take care of yourself. I am glad you are here and please stay healthy. Eat crazy foods and keep smiling. Especially you lady because you are my life.....CRAZY HUH !!!</p>
